Chatter is a comprehensive, lightweight, mega-configurable chat enhancement addon.

BUT, [the original](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chatter) has some problems:

* Bnet messages may fail to appear.
* Copying a webiste URL does not work.
* Alt-clicking a player to invite does not work.
* Clicking a bnet message to compose does not work.
* Channel Names module won't replace General, Trade, and LocalDefense.
* Player Names module won't replace or remove [name brackets].
* Likely a few others - comments / reports on the original are currently unanswered.

This new addon [fixes most of those](https://github.com/cog-videogames/chatter-patched/blob/master/qa.md). I figured fixing the bugs was easier than switching to Prat.

**Further bugfixes will probably not be implemented.**

You can see the full [diff vs upstream here](https://github.com/cog-videogames/chatter-patched/compare/upstream...master).  Please leave a comment here if you have a patch or file a Github PR.

If the original gets fixed I will probably retire this since I'm not really an addon developer.
