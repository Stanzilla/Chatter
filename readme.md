Chatter is a comprehensive, lightweight, mega-configurable chat enhancement addon.

BUT, [the original](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chatter) hasn't been updated since Aug 2019 and has some problems:

* Several crashes.
* Chat Backgrounds are broken.
* Channel Names module won't replace General, Trade, and LocalDefense.
* Player Names module won't replace or remove [name brackets].
* Pet battle frames [are broken](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chatter-patched-for-shadowlands?comment=10).
* Likely a few others - comments / reports on the original are currently unanswered.

This new addon fixes problems #1, 2, and 3. I figured fixing the bugs was easier than switching to Prat.

**Further bugfixes will probably not be implemented.**

You can see the full [diff vs upstream here](https://github.com/cog-videogames/chatter-patched/compare/upstream...master).  Please leave a comment here if you have a patch or file a Github PR.

If the original gets fixed I will probably retire this since I'm not really an addon developer.
